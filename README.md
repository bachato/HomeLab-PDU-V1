# **ShrikeLab PDU V1** - 5 & 10 port USB-C PDUs for 10" and 19" racks
These PSUs are power delivery solutions for micro PC clusters and homelabs that suits either 10" and 19" racks. All variants are built around a Meanwell HRP-300-24 featuring either 5 or 10 USB-C power delivery ports enclosed in sheet metal or 3D printed ABS/ASA housings.

Mini and micro labs are a great solution for homelabbing, but the power delivery options are often bulky and hard to manage due to the need for an individual power brick per computer.
This project helps fix this by consolidating power delivery for up to 10 65W micro PCs into a single unit that fits in either a 10" or 19" 1U rack. This differs from a conventional multi-port USB PD hub by not needing to re-negotiate any power delivery voltages when a unit is turned off or unplugged, or when the power load across ports changes drastically. Also the packaging is designed specifially for rack mounting, with active cooling and simple power switching.

- Add 40mm fan guide and buck converter writeup

# Variants:
All variants are built around a Meanwell HRP-300-24 and the same PCB. The housings are designed to fit in 1U of space in either a 10in and 19in server rack. 

## 10 Inch - Single:
The original 10" enclosure, a sheet metal body + lid make up the housing, with a 3D printed front and rear. 5 outputs.

## 10 Inch - 3D Printed - Unibody:
10" printed unibody enclosure, made to be as easy as possible with minimal additional hardware, with the trade-off of being a little harder to print. No inserts required, all bolts thread directly into the print material. Small hatch for attaching button + fan and connecting wiring to PCB.

<br>

## 10 Inch - 3D Printed - Modular:
10" printed enclosure, made to be more modular and mod-friendly but requires more M3 inserts and bolts to assebmle. The CAD folder for this variant also includes 'flipped' front and rear STLs that have the mounting tabs swapped, so that the USB-C ports and power intput will face the front of the rack instead of the rear.

## 10 Inch - Dual:
10" enclosure for external PSU's. 10 outputs, intended for use with alternative power sources like battery or solar, or for up-cycling external 300W PSUs.

## 19 Inch - SBS:
For people that couldn't possibly deal with a power input in the middle of the housing, this version has matching components side-by-side so inputs and outputs can be coordinated easier. One harness will require extending due to the layout.

# PCB:
All variants use the same 2 layer 1.6mm thick PCB. This folder contains production files that can be uploaded to a PCB service for manufacturing, JLCPCB is my go-to. PCB assembly is recommended unless you have capability to do SMD soldering with either a hot air station or reflow oven.
There is currently no option for a through-hole variant because the tranistor does not come in a TH package.


**Parameters for PCB manufacturing:**
- 2 Oz copper trace weight - This is a must for current rating
- 1.6mm PCB thickness

### PCB Notes:
- You can use either an LM2596S or and MP1584EN. Just move the mounting headers to the corresponding holes.
- Connectors J19, J20, J21, J22 are optional. Either used for additional power output, or testing.
- After assembly, set fan header output voltage **before** plugging any fans in.

### Power Delivery Modules:
THe board assembly contains 5 USB-C power delivery modules that are based on an XPM52C with the following power profiles.

12V/3A, 15V/3A, 20V/3.25A

**Low Power PDO:** 5V/3A, 9V/3A, 12V/2.5A, 20V/1.5A

**High Power PDO:** 5V/3A, 9V/3A, 12V/3A

There's an interesting article [here](https://mysku.club/blog/aliexpress/101076.html) (is in Russian so will need translating) that goes over the thermal performance of the power delivery chips at 65W.

### Buck Converter:
To power the 40mm chassis fans the main 24V rail needs to be stepped down to 12V. This can be done with either an LM2596S or MP1584EN, on the PCB there's header holes and labels for both. The LM2596S is much more popular, but the MP1584EN is newer and has less EMC. MP1584EN comes in multiple variants, **make sure to get the variable one so you're able to tune the fan voltage**.

### Cooling Fan:
The cooling fan used for the PCB is a Noctua NF-A4x20 powered via 12V stepped down from the switched 24V output. This fan is 40mmx40mm and 20mm thick. The fan output on the main PCB is DC only, so the 3-Pin FLX variant are recommended, however the 4-pin PWM version will also work. When assembling the main PCB, make sure to adjust the buck converter output voltage down below 12V before plugging in any fans. The RPM of the fans is adjusted by tuning the voltage output of the buck converter.

Replacing the internal fan of the Meanwell PSU requires opening the power supply unit. This should only be attempted by qualified personnel.
Mains voltage is present inside the PSU enclosure and can cause serious injury or death. Even with the unit powered off and unplugged, capacitors inside the PSU may retain a lethal charge for an extended period. Do not touch any internal components unless you are certain the unit has been fully discharged.

If you chose to replace the PSU fan, it can be plugged into the second header on the main PCB.


### Wiring:
There are two harnesses per set of internal electronics, one for main power and one for the button. The drawings can be found [here](https://github.com/Shrike-Lab/MiniLab-PSU/tree/main/ASSEMBLY/DRAWINGS/Electrial).

- **I would highly recommend you double check the pinout of your latching button before wiring it up, as they can differ from brand to brand.**
